Title: Make better visualizations in python with ggplot.

Introduction:

Have you ever found yourself sitting through a data-heavy presentation that felt overwhelming and made your head hurt? I know the feeling all too well. But, don't worry! There is a solution to this problem. By incorporating compelling graphics into your data presentations, you can make a significant difference. Believe it or not, visuals have the power to enhance comprehension, engage the audience, simplify complex concepts, support data-driven storytelling, improve retention and recall, and enhance credibility and professionalism. So, if you want to transform your data presentations and make them more impactful and effective, it's time to start using visuals effectively.

As a data scientist, I understand that time can be a constraint when creating visuals for presentations. It can be a challenge to balance efficiency with visual appeal in the exploratory data analysis phase. However, there are strategies to create compelling visuals that effectively communicate your ideas to clients. Simple PyPlot charts may not be enough, but with the right approach, you can create visuals that are both efficient and visually appealing.

In this oh-so article, I'm going to show a demo of how you can create plots that will make your audience go "Aha!" instead of checking their Instagram feeds during your presentation. No more awkward PyPlot visuals that elicit yawns and glazed-over eyes. Let's dive into these magical secrets of creating plots that will leave a lasting impression on your audience.

First things first, lets install some packages. 
`pip install lets-plot`



Okay. I'm sold, show me how:
