get in the cards get in the cardsthank you thank you very much ok thanks for filling these out and promise thisll be quick at diversity today our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations we believe that of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignoranceyou know what this is colorfreezone here stanley dont look at you as another raceuh see this is what im talking about we dont have to pretend were colorblindexactly were notthats fighting ignorance with more ignorancewith toleranceno with more ignoranceignoranceright exactly uh instead we need to celebrate our diversitylets celebrateright okcelebrate good times come on lets celebrate diversity rightyes exactly now heres what were going to do ive noticed thatyou know what heres what were going to do why dont we go around and everybody everybody say race that you are attracted to sexually will go last goi have two white and indianactually id prefer not to start that way michael would love to have your permission to run this session can have your permissionyesthank you very much and it would also help me if you were seatedokthank you ok now at the start of the session had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace now what im going to do is choose one and were going to act it outa few of the ground ruleshey hey why dont you run it by me and ill run it by himok can we steer away from gay peopleumim sorry its an orientation its not race plus lot of other races are intolerant of gays soparadoxwell we only have an houri figured it would save timeok why dont we just defer to mrmr brownah oh right ok first test will not call you thatwell its my name its not test ok um so looking through the cards ive noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident which is ironic because its the exact incident was brought in here to respond to now how many of you are familiar with the chris rock routine very good okhow come chris rock can do routine and everybody finds it hilarious and groundbreaking and then go and do the exact same routine same comedic timing and people file complaint to corporate is it because im white and chris is blackso were going to reenact this with more positive outcomei will play the chris rock guy would like to see someone else pull this offwell lets have someone who wasnt involved in the reenactmentok will play guy listeninggreat guy listening ok anyone else rememberi remembergreat youre the chris rock guy and youre guy listeningokkevin is great guy hes great accountant he is not much of an entertainerbasically there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people every time the one type wants to have good time then the other type comes in and makes real messok im sorry im sorry hes ruin hes butchering it could you just let me every time every time black people want to have good time some ignant ass take care of my kidwait secondthey always want credit for something they supposed to dostop itwhat you want cookienow this is simple acronym hero uh at diversity today we believe it is very easy to be hero all you need are honesty empathy respect and openmindednessexcuse me im sorry but thats not all it takes to be herooh great well what is hero to youa hero kills people people that wish him harmoka hero is parthuman and partsupernatural hero is born out of childhood trauma or out of disaster that must be avengedok youre thinking of superherowe all have hero in our heartnow need you to take these forms this kind of expresses the joint experience we had today and need you to look em over and sign them as kind of group pledgei dont think can sign thisi cant leave until you dowell ok it says here that learned something and knew all this stuff already so know could sign something that says that taught something or that helped you teach something so pam where is she pam could we change something on thismichael can talk to you candidlysurewe both know that im here because of the comments you madeheres the thing this office think this is very advanced in terms of racial awareness and its probably more advanced than youre used to thats probably throwing you off little bitum its not throwing me need your signatureok well know you told me that several timesyes but youre not listening to me yours is the only signature needokthose are my instructions from the corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made the reason made copies for everyone was so you wouldnt be embarrassedwell here am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training and you dontdont worry about datingi wontok thank youyeah yeahi regret my actions regret offending my coworkers pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty empathy respect and openmindedness openmindedness is that even word into the workplace in this way can truly be hero signed daffy duck hes going to lose it when he reads thatyeah hi is mr decker around oh well could you just have him call me after lunch thank youi pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart do believe in that part of the pledge that just read but pledge come on mean who are we the girl scouts no look the guy mr brown he got us halfway there he got us talking well no got us talking he got us nothing he insulted us and he

downsizing okaybut theres no downsizing so just dontbottom line do need to be worriedmmm mm mm maybeit looks like theres gonna be downsizing and its part of my job but blah hate it think the main difference between me and donald trump is that uh get no pleasure out of saying the words youre fired youre foired uh youre foired it just makes people sad and an office cant function that way no way youre foired think if had catchphrase it would be youre hired and you can work here as long as you want but thats unrealistic soits real shame cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through watercooler gossip than through official memos which puts me at disadvantage because bring my own water to workwhyd you do thisi didnt do it what do you mean oh the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance so what do you guys hear whats the scuttlebuttget set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott now think have had little stroke of genius in that have

this is my high school yearbook photo she saw it at the party and it really makes her laugh not sure why what else ooh this is hot sauce packet she put this on hot dog couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup and it was really funny so kept the other two this would take little too long to explain so wont and this is the card because christmas is the time to tell people how you

excessivethanks for the party michaelmerry christmas ho ho ho pimp im kidding what do we got what do we got how many plates are we gettingyeahfiftyoh hey listen up were going to poor richards whos indouble it double everything double ice cream double napkins double it on meim init was tough year had to fire somebody this year this party has to really rock check it out christmas bonus gs got this for helping save the company money so guess some good came out of firing devon after all maybe should call him and tell him thatyesi want people to cut loose want people making out in closets want people hanging from the ceilings lamp shades on the heads want it to be playboy mansion party and also want you to spread the word that will have my digital camera and ill be taking pictures all along the way and the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter incentivemichael poor richardsyou do realize that we cant serve liquor at the partyyeah that sounds goodyeah know damn it stupid corporate wet blankets like booze ever killed anybodychristmas is awesome first of all you get to spend time with people you love secondly you can get drunk and no one can say anything third you give presents whats better than giving presents and fourth getting presents so four things not bad for one day its really the greatest day of all timeone two threehey meredith

elfthat makes sense because he has elfish featuresokay everybody listen up it is time to get your presents wrap them and place them under the tree like so if you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from secret santa all right no exceptions except michaeli got angela she is into these posters of babies dressed as adults got her one of those felt kind of weird buying thati got creed and to tell you the truth dont know anything about creed know his names creed know he works right over there think hes irish and i got him this shamrock keychaini got myself for secret santa was supposed to tell somebody but didntyou get something good this yeari think did pretty good jobyeah who did you havewell cant tell you cause its secreti think got something pretty nice for my guyyeahi spent lot of dough lot of dough wowwell theres limit right so yeah wanted this party to be really special so sorta went above and beyondthats great well dont tell me who it is cause can it was ryan yeah have ryangather round secret santa lets go lets go come on stanley no im going to handle the cord okay safety reasonsi know how to plug something ini want to do itall right lets count it down like rockefeller center readythree two onenot greatim sorry everybodyi think the tree looks nicehey could get some flares from my carno no shake it off everybody just lets do secret santapresents are the best way to show someone how much you care its like this tangible thing that you can point to and say hey man love you this many dollars worthfirst present oscarshower radio neatoh good that was from methanks kelly you know was gonna get one of okay okay thats enough lets keep it moving on jimoh coolthats from megreat where did you get iti dont know it was so long agohe obviously forgot to get me something and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number and then threw it in bagyep thats exactly what happenedpamoh my god thank you very much santa whoever you are its awesometheres little more to itall right next ryanno dontwhoa video ipodwhoa wow jeez somebody really got carried away with the spirit of christmas that was me got little carried awaywasnt there limit on the gift this is bucksyou dont know thatyeah you left the price tag oni didyeahwhat oh shoot wow okay well who cares it doesnt matter what spent what matters is that christmas is fun rightmichaeloh hey for me what is in here oh come oni knitted it for youan oven mitt okayso phyllis is basically saying hey michael know you did lot to help the office this year but only care about you homemade oven mitts worth gave ryan an ipodshould we just keep opening up the presentswe dont do anything until michael gives us further instructionsi got it we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swapwhat is yankee swapone person chooses gift the next person can either choose gift or steal that persons gift if your gift gets stolen then you can steal somebody elses gift or choose new gifti thought that was called nasty christmasyeah we call it white elephantwell call it funwhy are we doing thisbecause its better because its more specialit sounds meanshut it no its not okay just give it shotmichael should have asked the party planning committee first hes not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhereokay meredith is up first heres the deal you can either pick new gift or you can steal somebody elses gift that theyve already gotten like the oven mittill take the teapotoh shouldnt we bought that specifically for pamyankee swap thats what makes it fun pam you can steal the oven mitt nowill take the ipodand have to give it to her dont have choiceyes now you can steal the oven mitt the old shirt or the shower radio or pick new giftthat was meant for kellyyeah figuredi think this is going greatyikeswell its for angela so thats like the creepiest thing that ive ever seenangela youre upill take the poster some people like thesei will steal the ipodeveryone wants the ipod its huge hit it is almost christmas miracleoh well oscar you little gourmand you have the next turnill take the teapotdamn itokay moving along meredith lets goi really want the ipodits already been stolen this round pick something elsei hope nobody takes this baby cause this is great wow look at that fine craftsmanship somebody really put lot of work into that its beautifulill take the oven mittsucker see wanted somebody to take it boom reverse psychologyreverse psychology is an awesome tool dont know if you guys know about it but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid works like charmin addition to these paintball pellets your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schruteyou and me michael yeswho wants to take paintball lessons how is that better than an ipodi never said it was better than an ipodmichael keeps bragging about his ipod but you know what two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as am is worth easily like grandtake that saddamlast gift kevini want the foot baththats the thing bought myself im really psyched to use it maybe should have taken the ipod oh shootpam steal something or pick the final gifti want the ipoddamn itsure you dont want the teapotwell mean its an ipod but rightsorry no no definitely its okay well guess will take that book of short storiesyes there you go want the teapot graciasgot to be kidding meyankee swap is like machiavelli meets christmaswhat is she so upset aboutmaybe because you hated her present so muchcome on think that yankee swap was big hit think its success and im the one who ended up with dwights stupid paintball pelletsyeah but michael the point is that we all bought gifts for specific peopleand you should have just bought gift like everyone elsewell didnt got big bonus because fired devon and used the money to buy something awesome sue meyou got bonus checkhow muchit wasnt it wasnt that much it was all right im done nowunbelievable do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out well happy birthday jesus sorry your partys so lameit comes to all right now youre the expert is this enough to get people plasteredfifteen bottles of vodka yeah that should do itcool cool box it upi bought this teapot for pam and know she really wants it so can trade you for itno tradescome on its shamrock keychain good lucka real man makes his own luck billy zane titaniclook it has sentimental value dwight can buy it from youno want it im going to use ityou dont even drink teatrue but get sinus infections and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems okay and pouring it directly into your nose like soto think that my gift for pam will be used for that its little too much to handlethis is awesomei know its totally going to change the way work outyeah was gonna get you one of these for christmas and now dont have to im gonna save ton of moneyso what are you going to get me insteadi dont know probably like sweater or somethinguhoh looks like santa was little naughtywhat is

necessarily you can love boss like you do fatherim not sure that ever happenswell okay different management styleswhy cant your workers be your workers family be your family your friends be your friendslast week would have given kidney to anyone in this office would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them but now no dont have the relationship with these people that thought did hope they ask so they can hear me say uh no only give my organs to my real friends go get yourself monkey kidneyhey brenda this is uh jim halpert from the boat and got your number from the corporate directory and well was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out right um so gimme call back you can get my number from said directory um or just check your email cause just sent you one yikes uh give me call back hope ill talk to you later byeyou just asked girl out on the phoneyepyeshello yes im looking for gay nerd named michael scottwho is this how did you get this numberyour mom you gay nerdoh my god packer packster whacky pack how you doinhey did you get that package left for youuh no did anybody see package here today no how big was itit was pretty bigreallyyeahdid you see big package where did you leave itleft it in the middle of your officeso im happy to be here its very nice to see all of you youre all looking welli think you should all spend little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stufftodays women in the workplace thing jans coming in from corporate to talk to all the women about um dont really know what but michaels not allowed in she said that about five timesmmmm think were all okay with the balance weve struckwomen today though we have the same options as men we often face very different set of obstacles in getting there soat least you dont have kids you have no kids right thank godhey whats going onokay lets take five think we can all use fivemichael thought we agreed you wouldnt be herehow can someone so beautiful be so sadyeah you know what i just thought about it just have few things want to sayhiwhat are you doingdid you take care of the situationhold just hear me out what is more important than quality equality now studies show that todays woman the ally mcbeal woman as call her is at crossroadsyuh yuh yes i have essentiallymichaelexcuse meno just uh you have come long way baby but just just want to keep it within reasoni have essentially yes ive taken somemichaelexcuse me ive been told theres been some interest in forming union and that michael supported it obviously hes not friend of yours because he didnt tell you the facts so let me if there is even whiff of unionizing in this branch can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that they unionized in pittsfield and we all know what happened in pittsfield it will cost each of you fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs so would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send message if you have any further questions you can direct them to to michaelthey did this up in albanydreams are just that theyre dreams they help get you through the day like the thing about the terrace its nice but um dont know it was just something read in this book when was twelve the girl in the book has terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and just loved that just always kind of stuck with meyou are not allowed in this sessionso youre not doing itand they ended up turning the break room into lactation room which is disgusting sohow did you knownow youre really not allowed in this sessionwhy notwell im their boss so feel likejust like no big reason just bunch of little reasonsim your bosscome onanybody want any coffee orroys right theres no guarantee its going to lead to anything anywaywere fine michael we just need you to leave pleaseroy said thatwomen in the

oscar vent little we would use the break room but the photographers back there todaywhats the problemangelaits just little dispute over poster in their workspacesince christmasso what youre having little spat forget are you guys datingnomichael can talk to you for uh second pleaseyesheres how usually handle thisyeahthese things just have way of working themselves outokayits like if you write someone letter when youre really angry they say to keep it in drawer for couple days then you just never end up sending itwhat do you know about conflict resolution your answer to everything is to get divorced sookayokay whatthat was the right decision for me and my marriageyeah well thats not gonna fly here because in this office it is till death do us part assuming we dont get downsized uh pam will you get angela and meet us in the conference room pleasea mediators tool chest okay well before we get started you should know that are different styles of conflict my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey stylecan we go have lot of work to dono okay this is important the first style is loselosewhats the next onejust hold on please okay if we do loselose neither of you gets what you want do you understand you you would both lose now need to ask you do you want to pursue loselose negotiationcan we just skip to whatever number is winwin or whateverwinwin is number four and number five is winwinwin the important difference here is with winwinwin we all win me too win for having successfully mediated conflict at workokay since this is the disputed poster now one at time want you to express your feelings using emotion language and no judging or you statementsi got this poster for christmas and feel want to see it everyday it makes me feel like the babies are the true artists and god has really cute sense of humorcome on seriously thati dont like looking at it its creepy and in bad taste and its just offensive to me it makes me think of the horrible frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it its kitsch its the opposite of art it destroys art it destroys souls this is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno im talking about theokay okay stop stop stop lets see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are winwinwinyes thank you pam how about angela makes the poster into tshirt which oscar wears that way he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar she can see it winwinwinnothats nookay well brainstorm own the solutionhow about leave it uphow bout she takes it downhow about angela can keep it up on tuesdays and thursdaysokay that is called compromise and it is style and it is not ideal to sum up winwin make the poster into tshirt winlose take the poster down compromise tuesdays and thursdays and the answer is make the poster into tshirt winwinwinfinebut itit is donewinno youre all goodgreathey angela didnt have your zip codeoh thanksit was hand delivered but did get save the date after all its not my tasteyou solved ityeswell good we can uh throw that one outare those all the other complainsmmmhmi would like to see those pleasei cant do thatyou cant do that huh huh ok now you and have conflict

gay pride right gay pride parade its not like gay shame festivalall right now oscars feeling discriminated against by his coworkers primarily angela and um thats your faulti think angela might be gay could oscar and angela be having gay affair maybe is that what this is aboutnoi dont knno its not possibleanythings possibleyou know imagine you were gaywell im not gay jan and you should know that better than anybodymichael your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now do you understandthe company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to years of being weirded out by gaysam the first gay man you ever knewtrick question cause you cant always tell so how would know is that the right answermichael dwights looking at gay pornography on his computeruh michael knows pam he asked me to do this just for him he has his own reasonsnothing wrong with this stuff at all this is fine you

some of your friendsall right everybody in the conference room dont care if you are gay or straight or lesbian or overweight just get in here right nowdid you know that gay used to mean happy when was growing up it meant lame and now it means man who makes love to other menwere all homos homosapiens gays arent necessarily who you think they are people mean anybody could be gay businessmen like antique dealers or hairdressers or accountants oscar why dont you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here however you want to do it go ahead stand up im doing this for youyes im gay and didnt plan on sharing that part of my life with you today so whatever can sit down nowwho should be the judges and juries of our societyjudges and juriesyes thats good point she has good point because gay marriage currently is not legal under us law bet lot of straight men wish that applied to them so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sx as much as they could you

electricity were using to keep meredith alive we could power small fan for days you tell me whats unethicali am not going to finish cant beat rabies nobody can beat rabies rabies has been around for thousand years was fool to think that could beat itblink once if you want me to pull the plugtalk about itdont pull any plugsyeah probably hey michaelhow are you doing ms palmerwhat are you doing here did you come back for us orbetteri cant finish feel so weak justexcellentwell youre probably dehydratedare you doctor or male nursewhat do you want me to do jimum im an intern which makes me doctor butglass of water would be startpfft her chart doesnt indicate that she had hysterectomy but she did or at least she got time off for oneno there are people all over the world who have all sorts of problems and afflictions and diseases theyre deformed and theyre abnormal and theyre illiterate and ugly symphonies dont have any money public tv is bust cant do anything about it cant you know theres just one of me and theres thousand of them and rabies winsah so uh so that is where her uterus went um ms palmer your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by bat few months agowow you are downer we were having pretty nice dayyes dwight here trapped it in bag against my headim still having nice dayjust doing my jobyou areit also says you were recently bitten by raccoonyeah hey michael look at this lamp and rat separate occasionsthats good dealyou spend your whole life trying to get people to like you and then you run over one person with your car and its not even one of the popular ones and everybody gets on your case doesnt make any sense god is deadand michael you dont have rabies and chances are youre not going to get it anytime soon so you dont really have to think about it too muchif there was god then ryan and would be married by nowpam if everybody felt that way nothing would get donemaybe believing in god was the mistake what did people believe in before the sun maybe theres some sort of animal that we could make sacrifice too like giant buffalo or some sort of monster like something with the body of walrus with the head of sea lion or something with the body of an egret with the head of meerkat or just the head of monkey with the antlers of reindeer with ah the body of porcupineyeah but theres other better people out there who are helpingi will do some researchyou just dont think am capable of making differencei can help you with thati know you michael saw you nakedso just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccineyou dont you dont know me youve just seen my pens can make difference remember im the one who started this whole thing off by hitting meredith with my car and owe it to her to finish this gd no nooh god rabiesfinishing that was the hardest thing have ever had to do ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water than have in my entire life people always talk about triumphs of the human spirit well today had triumph of the human body thats why everybody was applauding for me at the end my guts and my heart and while eventually puked my guts out never puked my heart out and im very very proud of thatmmhmmhey michaeli was in the hospital room with her how contagious is that is that like an stdhey mer how ya doingno no youve gotta be bitten by somethingbetterthis place is so cursedits ironic isnt it mean im in the hospital for not getting enough water and youre in it for disease that causes the fear of wateractually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in lock jawim in because you hit me with your car but wanted to say heard you were trying really hard so im not mad at you anymorei know lot of you are upset with me for endangering merediths life by hitting her with my car but it may make you feel little better to know that before that happened dwight endangered her life by putting garbage bag over her head that had bat in itthanks im not mad at you anymore wanna sharesix of one reallysureturns out meredith has been exposed to rabies which is like times worse than little crack in your pelvis thanks

do with her recent breast enhancement surgeryyes and frankly the timing was nothing short of predominantwhat about your romantic relationship with ms levinson could that have played part in her terminationwell if it did then the company is breaking its own rulesinteresting how sobecause before we started dating we disclosed our relationship to hr and have the proof right hereokay the company has just few clarifying questions mr scott if thats okay with youi will allow itum would you mind please just uh taking quick look at uh this photograph pleaseuhthat is you and ms levinson in jamaica is that correctuhhuhand that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship does that sound right mr scott the timeline here is actually very important please when did your relationship actually beginugh well dedepends on how you define begin mean if it was from the first time we shook hands thats like six years ago if its from the first time we kissed thats like two years agowait excuse meif it was the first time we kissed sober it was like four months after thatcould we take short breakno uh are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago

girlfriend however jan clearly didnt consider me to be her boyfriend so her actions are completely rightfulok mr scott its its admirable the way you defend woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with youthank you very much you didnt have to say thatconsidering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviewsthat was before our relationship she was going through divorce and she was drinking lot of watermr scott this is copy of particularly negative performance review would you mind uh reading the date on that pleasemarch thand that would be month after your relationship became official is that correctyesyou may read the uh highlighted portion out loud if youd like toi am out of carrots am out of sticks mr scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee and poor branch manager recommend he be removed from that position and reassigned to sales where he belongsmr scott after hearing that wouldnt you say ms levinsons judgment is at

thats good place to end it right there this think was great ethics seminar she has given us lot of wonderful things to think about right what is wrong whos to say really in the end mean because it is unknowable but lets give her round of applause holly everybody holly get back to work great job am truly impressed that uh you really pulled that one out classic classic meeting we should celebratemichael there is some serious issues with meredithohi mean all of you have done things wouldnt have done myself but merediths actions are really over the linennyeah what ya gonna doso regarding this supplier approximately how many liaisons have there beenliaisons you mean meetups dont know once month for six years something like thatmeredith why dont you tell holly its not what she thinks nothing unethical happened and that you just like to sleep aroundam in trouble here or somethingno no this is just stupid formalityno its not formality now were these um meetups just personal unrelated to businessnah wouldnt have done it if it wasnt for the discount paper theres not lot of fruit in those loomsughh for the love of god were trying to help you stupid bagwhat dont understand is why the steak coupons mean if you were already getting the discounted paperwell its funny maybe its girl thing but after we did it and he would give me those coupons just felt good about myself hey whats going on here thought had immunitywell unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace mean ive never heard of anyone whos kept their job after something like thiswell im not quittingyawn four secondswhat are you doingoh you had said that you dont do anything personal during work time so im just making sureoh so wait minute youre going to time me every time yawn thats absurd really oh hey look monkey knows how to use stopwatch everybody hes tipersonal conversation seventeen secondsthere is no way that that wasone secondwell well holly lujah its miracle youre at your deskits mikeraculoushooooh reaching youll get there anyway was giving it some thought and theres no reason that two attractive good looking intelligent funny attractive

get the boring stuff out of the way autumn was what was going to say when the leaves change its just i think it is the most contemplative of seasonsok so have gone over this and have thought about it and just dont think there is any way can write report that doesnt end with her being terminatedwow terminator terminatorim from da futureyeahhey andyyoby any chance did you see battlestar galactica last nightno did not was that any goodactually not it was really sosooki mean like all the crazy monsters and stuff you know like klingons and wookies and all that but sorry was there something you wanted to add dwightis that anything like the original battlestar galacticayou know its weird its practically shot for shot remakereally huh thats coolstorys kinda bland its about this guy named dumbledore calrissian who needs to return the ring back to mordorreally that doesnt sound righti just dont want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance mean what sort of place is that to call home and meredith needs this job this is her main source of moneywell thats very sweet but we have to follow the protocol those are the rulesok new idea we dont report it at all we just punish herwe punish hermmhmm tell her she cant have sx for six monthsi dont think we could enforce thati dont know saw this thing like belt with keya chastity beltno its more of underwear garment that has little spikes like made of sometimes they are made of metal you know what am talking about you unlock little door that down where you where you put where you put thehe has not stopped working for second at am just saying that dont think that you understand what am sayingno you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet accept the discount on supplies not fire meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happenedyeswhat am sayingwell bleh busted dontim saying that her behavior is unethical and little icky and dont think want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is toleratedwell you have to tolerate lot when you are part of familyits not family its workplacei will be honest with you that car ride did not go well and that was not my fault the only reason am standing out here right now is because dont want to take the elevator with her and am holding on to her leftovers minutes and seconds what were we doing for minutes and secondsnone of your businessso guess can assume that was personalfineso maybe youre not completely ethical after allyes maybe im notits been little tense people are suspicious of me and my best friend in the office wont even talk to me turns out being the morality police does not make you popular should know because in middle school was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker was just hoping middle school was overkendall from corporate hr is on line one and holly is on her way in toowhats the only thing worse than one hr reptwo hr repsyou get mecan siti dont know can you kendall my main manlisten holly michael just got the report that your branch submitted and theres lot of stuff about relationship meredith is having withyes that came out during the ethics seminarlet the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminarwell im not sure these circumstances warrant any actionoh think it is pretty clear that it was unethicalwell from what can gather it seems like gray area look to be honest the company is getting discount at tough time in our balance sheet and dont know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at thatumm kendall understand that the discount is good for the company but im just not happy about the way we are getting iti thought it was clear with you holly your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the trainingno understandevery other branch has managed to get this to us so if its not something you can handle then thats different discussionno can do itgoodhow do you tell somebody that you care about deeply told you so gently with rose in funny way like its hilarious joke or do you just let it go because saying it would just make things worse probably the funny waycan have everyones attention excuse me may have everyones attention please we need to finish the ethics seminarno way ladyits trapeveryone please just need your signatures to show corporate that gave you the trainingdont sign anythingok everybody listen up if you are not in that conference room in two minutes am going to kill youits quarter to five and have started to gather my thingsget in there right

anything to anyone for any reason ever no matter what no matter where or who or who you are with or or where you are going or or where youve been ever for any reason whatsoeversometimes ill start

degrees cooler in here always think better when its coolerheres the thing michael is doing something right and in this economic climate no method of success can be ignored its not really time for

new way to relate more positively to my surroundings im going to diedunder mifflin this is pam uh im sorry michaels not here right now can take message great will thanksandyits very unusual for michael not to show up to work my guess hes either deeply depressed or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain he has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them and always say michael take two steps back and stare at the icicle from the side and hes like no like the way they look from standing directly underneath thema throne for your highnesshe is so dumb that he tries to put his mms in alphabetical orderim not sitting in wheelchairalright kevin enough with the michael jokes think he got it bad enough yesterdayno no no no debate you are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feetim almost doneim going to diethat reeks and im trying to eatabc okay and hat stands for airway breathing and circulationattention everyone just got text from michael he says personnel day are we hiringokay you know what that could be little confusing because in sales abc means always be closingyep youre being replacedthis is farce should be teaching this coursei think he meant personal dayshut it shut itoh thats quite leap pamwe found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his when his heart went berserk and knew exactly what to do but in much more real sense had no idea what to do so thought we should have cpr training class and of course you cant get the practice dummy unless the instructor

speak on the recordplease dojim is like big bird he is tall and yellow and very nice but would put him in charge no dont think so because big bird doesnt make the tough decisions if was gonna put someone in charge would put burt in charge or would put one of the real grownups in charge like maria or gordon maybei thought you liked jimvery much jim is my best friend but its his performance report right here now this was written by toby who we all know is extremely reliableconstant office distractions spends way too much time at reception antagonizes other salesman not at all what he thinks he isits not very well written but you get the gistis there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branchi can just continue to run it myselfjim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then jim would be promoted to your positionthis was jims ideammhmmwow ummm well id have to talk to my mother and my guy at and blockummm okay heres the thing though the plan doesnt work unless we have someone to replace you was hoping plus we have to worry about jim he has another job offer we may

well here he is right now come inhi davidhey guys so spoke to alan we had kind of an unconventional idea which think is pretty cool but it only works if everyones on boardwell just as long as it means jim becomes managerwe were thinking of having two branch managers in scranton both of you guys working as comanagers jim would handle the day to day and michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuffwow that sounds pretty cooli like that so manager and comanagercomanager and comanager see there are lot of moving pieces and this is the only way can sell it upstairswell that might be little confusing for people because they know me as manageralright hey michael can you pick up for one second okay look im not going to force you into anything if youre willing to lose jim fine you just say so and well find another solution okay is that what you want to dookay people listen up have an announcement to make fraud was committedokay everybody have an announcement to make whoa do you

just keep avoiding us like thiswelcomethank youthank you ive noticed weve been having lot of conference room meetingsyoure welcomemmhmmwhats in hereand im wondering if perhaps those are bit umgindisruptiveoohyesjust pretend were not hereno dont think they are think the meetings are very importantheard you guys are looking for cash for the weddingokay maybe we should talk specificsyeah mean if its all the same for youlets doquestion for you would you guys rather have now or year from nowokay yesterday we had meeting about planets now for suren well to be fair jim james jimothy to be fair jimothy the ah that sounds weird are you okay with being called jimbecause you just give me to cover the broker fee put in hundred of my own money as the gifti amyeah no no ill um the hundred ill just take the hundredalright jim to be fair the conversation wasnt about planetsinstead of year from nowrighthow sure is thisat first we were talking about introducing line of toilet paper and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon so you draw line from there to the other planets and think by the end we all learned little bit about how small we arethe guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball gameyes agreedont tell jimbecause its big universe and were all just little tiny specks of dusti just think that maybe theyre eating large amounts of the dayyou know what eats large amount of the day are naps you go to sleep its light out you wake up its dark thats the whole day where did that day go have no ideayou mean on weekendyeshow about this think our goal should be we dont have meetings unless theyre absolutely essentialalright no more meetings this weekreally you just agreed to thati can be very suprisingwhats going oni need to fit into my wedding dress however im also pregnantyou know its myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in pregnancy look at these actresses some of them lose weighthey did you guys register for wedding giftswe did but mostly because people expect us to were also accepting other gifts not on the registry however muchits awkward asking people for money but we could really use it why doesnt crate barrel let you register for toaster full of cashperfect hate registriesoh goodmy cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes know shouldnt tell you but youll still be suprised when you see it youre not registered for birdhouse are youno were notgood goodmmhmmokay thought saw people missingyeah just focusgrouping product expansion idea to these folks got one of eachreally hey stanley what was the last thing michael said before came through the doorstanley you dont need to answer thatstanleyif you dont smell this youre firedokay michael thought we agreed to not take up peoples time with meetings like thesewhat do you mean by these peoplemichael this is conference room meetingoh hey everybody think that jim has gone insane because he thinks that my office is conference roomthats not what meantlisten jim no offense but when push comes to shove what want is more important that what you wanti disagreewhat do you guys thinkgreat guys can just have moment alone with michaelno no no you dont need to go anywhere anything that jim has to say to me he can say in front of these types of peoplethat is not what said and also am comanager meaning you are not the only manager anymore am also comanagerthat is not what wallace told usthats exactly what wallace told usthat is not the way heard iti love rivalries michael or jim paris or nicole heidi or lc its so much fun but guess if im really thinking about it and answering your question honestly id have to go with lc heidis bad friend and her skin is terribleit is one thing me giving you the comanager title it is another thing you bossing me aroundim not bossing you around im trying to do my job which is sharing your job so maybe we should just call david wallaceno no no no we will not call david wallace will call david wallacedavid wallace is on line two for you guysor david wallace will call us on line two why dont we justhey david you got jim herehey david this is michael senior comanagerhey guys um im calling because unfortunately we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year and know people expect it however there just is only small amount of money for each branch so were leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute itgot it dave sounds like your classice bigpicture decisionwhich will clearly affect the daytoday wellbeing of our employeesits probably little of bothwhich is it more ofexcuse medavid know that im very new at this but have very good perspective on how things workwait im sorry michael are you are you texting mei thought maybe we could talk after this is overlook need you both to take care of this this is not going to be problem is itnope not at allno it will not be am on top of itvery goodalright thanks alot davidtalk to you later okay you didnt let me say goodbye alright am looking forward to thisyou dont have to liei hate the fact that we have to do this together think we work better separately when am irritated and look at you dont see you anymorerightall can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose arealright lets get startedhey why havent we ever umwe haveyou know theres no easy way to do this say we add to their paychecks and dont say anything about itdo you mean like breakin in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payrollno we can do it during the day it doesnt have to be that dramatic jimokay you know what would help is pros and cons list for our optionsjim dont take this the wrong way are you gonna take this the wrong wayits hard to tell so faryou use your brain too muchim sorry are you advocating that use it lesssometimes the smartest people dont think at allyou just came up with thatas was saying ityeah okay so for the increase pro everyone gets little bitcon you look like nerdcon no one gets as much as they did last yearpro you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerdspro no favoritismcon you unzip your pants and you find that theres calculator down thereive been studying michael for years and ive condensed what ive learned into this chart how michael spends his time as you can see we have procrastinating and distracting others and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking made it bigger so that you could see ithey pam heard that you were registered but didnt hear wherei dont think we registered anywhere we just want cashlike money like you you want my moneymmhmmwill you take checkyeahcool in the memo line im gonna write to loves eternal gloryokaywait til mondayis this what ive become materialistic shallow feel horrible oh look mrs pam halpert thats the first time ive seen it in writingyou know the more think about it the more think we should give it to the salesmenthat will not go over welli know just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now course know that this might come off as biased so you know what let usoh my god are you gonna make another pro and con list im gonna kill myselfim not gonna let you stop me from thinkingno could not do that jim can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect if can just think this through if could just think it exactly right can make this perfect and then can go down every avenue and every avenue off of that avenue and then another avenuemichaeland then anotherlook you have lot of strengthsoh do tell me what they arei think that you are able to take constructive criticism very wellha that am not known for thatbut there is reason why im hereyes you went over my head to wallaceno its because you also have lot of weaknesses michaelokay well why dont you tell me what those are jim why dont you enliven mei dont think youre good at making tough decisionsahat thinking out the options and then stating that decision very clearly especially when its an unpopular decisionokay heres tough decision for you you suck you suck is that clear enough for youbut maybe im here for reason because might have some good ideas too ive been sitting out there and ive been learning lot and maybe can just bring something different to the tableokay skippy here we go why dont you run yourself out there and tell them you call itthis had better be terriblecould have everyones attention please have some tough news so im just gonna give it to you straight truth is we only have so much money for raises this year so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people wont now what weve decided is we are gonna give those raises to the sales staffwait seriouslylook you guys are smart so im just leveling with you im just trying to treat you like adultsthank you jim for thinking that were smart peoplebut do not understand if were such smart adults then why dont we get raisesexcellent question genius its because jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps withooh easy thats not it at allwellreally what it is is about the money the sales staff brings into the officewhats going onjim is only giving raises to the salesmenwhat the hell why are you being such jerkhold on kelly would it help you to know that jim thinks youre smartno how is that gonna repair ryans carthis is ridiculous how could he do this to usokay dwight you know what youd be getting the raise sowhat about all these people huh how is it fair to themexactlytotallywe work just as hard as the sales people we deserve raisesyesyes they dont get em if we dont get emmy kid needs shoes you want to tell him he doesnt get shoesyeahher kid needs shoes jimwhat the hellwow im just gonna rewind and back off bit sothat was good that was good okay all right well we all know its hard to be boss right you know what look around you these are your best friends these are the people who will open their hearts to you they all have heartons for you and that is gift so in terms of gifts we should be giving each other gifts angela yes lend oscar cup of sugar thiswhat are you talking about michaelwe just need to hear your plan for our raisemy plan man panamathats not how that goesyoure not saying anything at least jim was being directthank you meredithwhen he was telling us his dumbass planwe would just like to know whats happening are we getting raise yes or noalright let me get this clear does everybody want raise alright everyone wants raise so what were going to do is go into here and we will not come out until we doagain that gives us no informationthis isnt game you know its our livelihoodwhat about raise based on meritrank each person individuallymmhmm piece of cake ryan obviously the bestwell obviously too bad hes temp and doesnt count so lets get startedare you making anope im numbering the paperjustyeah dont understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of usits not like were not gonna see the checks were in accountingi am so pissed at this companyand jimyeah who said thati think it was creedyepits going really well actuallyeach boston baked bean represents half percent raise we each got beans so the idea is you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv whos thattobyhes not part of this you know thatjust wanted to

this in privatei dont want to be in private is it true or is it notyeswho else did you sleep with did you sleep with phyllis or kelly or pam maybe all togetherno no neverdid everyone know was the only one who didnt knowyeah pretty muchwho are you dont know youi should probably get involved in this but think my energy is better spent on the cookie monster issueerin you know if had been engaged to anyone before you wouldve told youthanksso if you need anything im right over therehey erin you look delicious mean beautifulok ok there heard that so im sorry pam but thats it im going to have to suspend you without pay for two dayswhat what do you mean suspend mei think you need to go little easy you cant just suspend someone form workyeah youre right you know what um youre suspended too jim ok fine you too dwightwait what was just slowclapping your nononsense decisionmakingi dont want to hear it suspendedc is for suspensionwhy would that be something to talk about on secretarys dayandy shes not the easiest person in the world to have conversation with all right and besides who doesnt tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them thats like thats like mr and mrs smith crapi was going to tell her just on my own timeyou know what resent the implication that would keep that secret everyone here knows that cant and wont keep secretwho cares mean its not like killed someone big deal right this can blow over in two seconds she never asked me so if you think about it probably should have told her guess everybody does stupid thingspsst hey erinyou want to talk to me come to my deskyou embarrassed me earlieroh take it up with the chief of policeyou think want people remembering had sensual relations with andy its the kind of thing

there different can just put it through again you knowhey you know was engaged before jimreallyyeah and he worked here tooit was andy wasnt itno no it wasnt andy it wasnt it doesnt matter its not about who youve been with its about who you end up with sometimes the heart doesnt know what it wants until it finds what it wantsi hope you find what youre looking forthank youso can reprimand them but cant suspend them oh cant do either uh huh fair enoughhey tobyi called tallahassee he can ask you not to come in but he cant dock your pay thats not legalvery interestingyeah also learned some interesting things about how they structurethanks tobyhey everyone hi quite an afternoon huh cathartic in way im glad got to share it with you it makes you think about whats really important its not about showing youre in charge or flexing some sort of authority its about forgiveness and yes im talking about you three in this desk clump right here think that if you were to apologize to me then would revoke your suspensioni dont think an apology is enough really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspensionand got to take this bad attitude and got to go home and got to adjust it and hope the suspension does thatprideful idiots watch how its done gabriel apologizegreati kneel before youguys would even take contrite look as an apologyhumbly taking your hand upon which kiss to show my contritionguys to err is humantrust is the most important thing to me is your name andy bernard whats your real name lionel frankensteinwill you stop walking for one second thats

for sec what was that printer we were looking atyou didnt see it pam she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make move shortbreadnoill have onewell maybe you shouldnt try to kiss people at workoh really jim what about pam and you did heck of lot more than kiss maybe this could be my pamokay well all that is irrelevantmaybe michael has point mean if she was really that upset she wouldnt still be herewas it professional no but work in the nightlife industry get hit on all the time in my it would have been annoying in my late i find it really flatteringlook know that screwed up in there know that probably messed up your sale just want to go in and fix itwhat if back out and you finish the pitch with jimwhatwhat was thatjust let him flirt with her people meet each other all sorts of wayspam you know hes not gonna get anywhere and hes gonna blow our salewho cares its not that huge salehey the schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was huge saledont act like you understood anything that guy said good luck wingmanhow as being minority affected youwell theres lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an indian guyoh good and you resent

this arguing reminds me of very funny story you see this on my desk know who gave me this my girlfriend tara who lives in new york citythat is great question erin how do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend and was lover and was complicated part of my past and maybe just maybe part of my futurewait what girlfriendwowi havent told you about hershes one sassy black ladyi find that unlikely you email me when you get new zithollys coming back everybody and we have to have partyim man in my mids and still get zits think thats pretty interesting but you know what am not on trial here the scranton strangler is so anyway we have this great weekend and she drives me to the airport and we get to jfk but am flying out of laguardia so we laugh and laugh and laugh and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slomo drinking latte and at the end of the day she gives me this and she says michael maybe next time you should take cabim not sure the temporary replacement of an hr rep really warrants partyi didnt know you had girlfriendyou know what well postpone this party until then this is too important cancel this one dwight get rid of the treei do she isokaydid

party of my life so back to workoh really turn it on me well isnt that nice thank you very muchman worked hard worked so hard for this was after corporate constantly emailed joe wrote letters and know

been so long since my last letter it is three months since arrived at schrute farms and fear may never leave this place alive melvin fifer garrishallowed groundbut the battle at schrute farms was no battle at all it was code used by pacifists from both north and south who turned the pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and refuge from the waryou have to understand poets artists dancers â these kind of men preferred peace to war these delicate lovely men found place of refuge among the schrutes at schrute farms amidst the macho brutality of war this was place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight like to think of schrute farms as the underground railroad for the sensitive and well fabulouswow this is so much

his officenoim sorrythis is what was trying to tell youim not accustomed to people saying no to mewell bobby get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yesyoure both adults im sure you can figure this out between yourselvesi never allow sexual desire to influence business decision so find it best to excuse myself temporarily until ive had chance to make love and

and dont know how im gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that but do know that right here right now all can think about is spending the rest of my life with her again that could changewhen you lost the manager jobyesdid it affect you outside of the officehowi dont know what the technical term is penial softiosiserin am so glad that you trusted me you came to the exact right person for this no have never once experienced anything remotely like that neveroh okayokayokaywashington monumentoheiffel towerokay okayi saw you were getting along with ryan againhes so sweet he pointed to my latte and he said kelly that will be the color of our childrenyeah hes so great remember how it felt when he cheated on you thoughwhich timei am not going to let kelly throw her life away on ryan and it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician why you would even ask or were going to ask because i felt like that question was comingone of tobys eyes is getting smaller so theres that gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and meredith said she was interested and then gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket so ill

yearsyes my heart is so open am so at peace look at meredith shes disgusting those feet theyre like the paws of an orangutanim sorry guys this is probably on me got hated on pretty hard when that

food is made its kinda disgusting you learn lot but didnt wanna know any of iti brought in some new faces and one old always like devon hired him back after creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired the only person he fooled was kevin then the police showed up turns out creed was in the band the grass roots in the during that time the police say he sold drugs and

for over years ive done nothing but trick and prank him but tonightonly good surprises guten prankenoh um well you know i just just think would rather keep that private you know if youd been filmed for nine years of your life thered be some things that you just wanna keep to yourselfoh hey jim forgot to mention oftentimes in hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties there are accidental murders that wont be necessary tonighti hear ya what did it saygreat now we got three hours to fillwere gonna move on next question pleaseokay hold on are you sure mose isnt going to show updo you find that your life feels pointless now that nobodys actually filming you anymoreever since angela moved in and mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed hes been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thingyesmose has been weird thats so unlike himi wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed was it accurateyeah sure ill talk about it why not americans next cappella sensation aired my audition and when started sobbing uncontrollably apparently that struck chord with quite lot of people not very compassionate chord the clip went viral as they sayi got beef with that um for the first seven years was getting my phd in school psychology and they didnt show it yes was getting hammered but hey it was collegei have question for jim and pam everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how youre soul mates so pam how could you doubt that when jim moved to philadelphiayou cant just sit here and cryum you know what actually didnt handle that move uh very gracefully from not communicating to being little selfishoh can so just sit here and crylisten um was scared you know loved what had and didnt want to risk it and think that maybe did doubt him little too which was wrong because hes shown me time and again but when the documentary started airing people on the street told me that had this fairytale romance but there were lot of times last year where it did not feel like fairy tale but then it got deeper and it got stronger and now its better than fairy tale its like long book that you never want to end and youre fine with that because you just never ever wanna leave ittwo million hits in the first week and then the parodies started one from the philippines got million hits and the late night comedy guys had field day with itlike harry potteryeah like harry
